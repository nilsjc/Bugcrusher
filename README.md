# Bugcrusher
Simple game written in JS and phaser.io http://phaser.io/ <br/>
Run it from a locally server, like npm -> http-server <br/>
Very boring gameplay though. <br/>
Smash the bugs until they reach you at the top of the screen! <br/>
Start the game with spacebar <br/>
Smash with mousebutton. <br/>
Good luck!
